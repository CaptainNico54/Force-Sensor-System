# Print-Load-Sensor
Load cell board and code for detecting forces during 3D printing

### Why should you use this system?

This design originates from the need to monitor the forces during a peel move in any resin 3D printer (SLA)
The project can be used as a passive data collection tool to diagnose issues and learn more about the print, or can be integrated as a active peel system (on the machines that allow it) reducing the print time and improving the reliability of print by closely monitoring the forces and knowing when a peel has occur or slowing down a peel in case the load is becoming critical.
